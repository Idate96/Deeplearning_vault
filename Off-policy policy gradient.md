The objective is to obtain a gradient wrt the new policy using data generated by an older policy

Formula for off-policy policy gradient based on a policy with *old* parameters $\theta$ and new parameters $\theta'$
$$
\nabla_{\theta'}J(\theta') = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 0}^N \sum_{t = 0}^T \frac{\pi_{\theta'}(a_{i,t}|s_{i, t})}{\pi_{\theta}(a_{i,t}|s_{i, t})} \nabla_{\theta'}\log \pi_{\theta'}(a_{i,t}|s_{i, t}) Q_{i, t}
$$

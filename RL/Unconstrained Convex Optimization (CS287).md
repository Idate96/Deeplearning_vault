As a benchmarc you can try with [[Cross Entropy Method]]. It will be a baseline, that can be used to a lower bound for your optimization method. This is useful for debugging. 

(Page 6)
[[Convex Optimization Problem]] we look today are uncontrained. 

(Page 8)
Uncontrained optimization techniques:
- [[Gradient Descent]]
- [[Newton's Method]]
- [[Natural Gradient]]
- [[Momentum]], [[RMSprop]], [[Adam]]

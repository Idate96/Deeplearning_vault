Random variable y is conditinally indipendent of x given z iff:
$P(x, y|z) = P(x|z)P(y|z)$

It's like indipendence, but it's only three when you condition on z. So when you know z then the variables are indipendent. 

z = weather 
x = carrying an umbrella
y = pavement wet 

Once you know that it's raining, x and y become indipendent because they are affected by the common cause but don't affect each other.

Probability density function:
$p(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi})} \exp(\frac{-(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}$

We care about Gaussian becauce of the [[Central Limit Theorem]]

## Multivariate Gaussian 

$p(x; \mu, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2} |\Sigma|^{1/2}} \exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x - \mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x - \mu))$

$\Sigma$ is always a symmetric matrix and can be diagonalized.

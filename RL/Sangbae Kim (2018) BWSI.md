We haven't solved the ground mobility problem. The reason for this difference between air, water and ground on the other side is much more stiff. When you walk you are dealing with both air and ground, it's way more complex than the other two domains. 

Also when we deal with touch interaction, also robots never touch anything. Even wiring is usually done by humans. 

Robots now are very rigid, when they fall they never even move!

(force vs position control)

Agility->Impact! 
Q:*How do you apply forces and still balance yourself?*

Jumping is not hard but landing is very hard. Absorbing energy is very importance, deceleration muscles are super importance. Your calf muscles is strong enogh to rip off your tendon, but there is an algorithm that prevents that.

Electric motors are much more powerful than muscles. What is the problem to create robots then? Power available at very high speed, and our muscles are very slow and forceful. 

You need to be flexible and compliant to deal with impact forces. In this way you can sense without having a sensor, the electric motor is the sensor itself. The golgi tendon organ can measure force very well. 

This applied 270 Nm of torque on the human body (sports car 300 Nm)!

Cost of tranport is mileage in the animal world. 

Most organs of animal are SOFT!
